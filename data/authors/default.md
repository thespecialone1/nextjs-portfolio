Hey there! My name is Lahrasab and I'm an electrical engineer with a serious love for all things networking and communication. I've got my CCNA certification under my belt and a knack for understanding even the most complex networking concepts. Plus, I'm always down to chat about the latest and greatest in the tech world.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also proficient in web development, with experience in HTML, Tailwind CSS, and cloud deployment. I have studied the AWS Cloud Practitioner course and have the knowledge and skills to deploy applications and software on the cloud.

I am also interested in cybersecurity and have experience in penetration testing. I have created a WhatsApp bot using Node.js and have worked with the Reddit API.

So if you're looking for someone who can bring a fresh perspective, a sense of fun, and a whole lot of tech know-how to the table, you're in the right place. Check out my portfolio and blog to see what I'm all about. Thanks for stopping by!

In my portfolio and blog, I hope to share my knowledge and experiences in these areas, as well as any new skills and projects I undertake. Thank you for visiting!
