# NAT

`Network Address Translation (NAT)` is a networking technique that allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address. This is accomplished by translating the private IP addresses of devices on the local network into a single, public IP address that is used to communicate with the internet. NAT can help `conserve IP addresses`, `improve security`, and enable connectivity for devices on a local network.

# NAT

`Port Address Translation (PAT)` is a technique used in network address translation (NAT) that enables a single network device, such as a router, to translate the `IP address and port number` of packets passing through it. This allows multiple devices on a local network to share a `single public IP address and access the internet`. PAT is commonly used to conserve IP addresses and improve network security by hiding the internal network structure from external devices.

# NAT commands on a cisco router

```
1. ip nat inside source list interface overload
2. ip nat inside source static
3. ip nat inside
4. ip nat outside
5. ip nat enable
```

# Explanation of the above commands respectively

- First command specifies the inside interfaces and the source IP addresses that will be translated, as well as the interface and IP address that will be used for the translations.
- Second command specifies a static NAT mapping, which translates a specific local IP address to a specific global IP address.
- In third and fourth command uses the ip nat inside and ip nat outside commands to identify the inside and outside interfaces on the router.
- Fifth command uses the ip nat enable command to enable NAT on the router.

> To verify type this in enable prompt:

`ip nat inside source list 1 interface Ethernet1 overload`

```
